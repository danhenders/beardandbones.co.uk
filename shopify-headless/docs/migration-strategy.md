# Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for migrating Beard and Bones from the current Shopify theme to a headless architecture using Next.js and Vercel.

## Migration Approach

We will use a phased migration approach to minimize risk and ensure business continuity:

### Phase 1: Development & Parallel Setup

- Develop the headless storefront alongside the existing Shopify store
- Connect to the same Shopify backend using the Storefront API
- Implement core functionality and design elements
- Test thoroughly in a staging environment

### Phase 2: Soft Launch & Testing

- Launch the headless storefront on a subdomain (e.g., new.beardandbones.co.uk)
- Conduct A/B testing with a percentage of traffic
- Gather metrics and user feedback
- Fix issues and optimize performance

### Phase 3: Full Cutover

- Redirect the main domain to the headless storefront
- Implement proper redirects for SEO preservation
- Monitor performance and user behavior
- Maintain the ability to roll back if critical issues arise

## Technical Migration Plan

### 1. Data & Content Migration

#### Product Data
- All product data will remain in Shopify
- No migration needed as we'll fetch data via the Storefront API
- Ensure all metafields and custom fields are accessible via the API

#### Content Pages
- Migrate content from Shopify pages to Next.js pages
- Preserve URLs for SEO purposes
- Consider using a headless CMS for managing content (optional)

#### Blog Content
- Migrate blog posts to Next.js or a headless CMS
- Maintain post URLs and metadata for SEO

### 2. Custom Functionality Migration

#### Product Templates
- Recreate specialized product templates as React components
- Ensure all product types maintain their unique layouts and features

#### Custom Sections
- Convert all custom sections to React components
- Maintain visual consistency and functionality

#### Third-Party Integrations
- Implement all current third-party integrations in the headless frontend
- Test each integration thoroughly

### 3. SEO Preservation

#### URL Structure
- Maintain the same URL structure for products, collections, and pages
- Implement 301 redirects for any changed URLs

#### Metadata
- Preserve all SEO metadata (title, description, etc.)
- Implement structured data (JSON-LD) for products and collections

#### Sitemap & Robots.txt
- Generate a new sitemap.xml
- Update robots.txt as needed

### 4. Performance Optimization

#### Image Optimization
- Implement Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Set up proper image CDN configuration

#### Code Splitting
- Utilize Next.js automatic code splitting
- Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components

#### Caching Strategy
- Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for product and collection pages
- Set up proper cache control headers

## Testing Strategy

### Functional Testing
- Test all user journeys and critical paths
- Ensure all features work as expected
- Verify third-party integrations

### Performance Testing
- Measure and compare performance metrics with the current site
- Use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Core Web Vitals
- Optimize based on test results

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Test on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test on various devices and screen sizes

### User Acceptance Testing
- Conduct UAT with stakeholders
- Gather feedback from real users

## Rollout Plan

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] All critical features implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds targets
- [ ] SEO elements properly implemented
- [ ] Analytics and tracking set up
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures in place

### Launch Sequence
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Verify deployment
3. Update DNS records
4. Monitor traffic and performance
5. Be prepared for quick fixes

### Post-Launch Activities
- Monitor analytics and user behavior
- Address any issues promptly
- Gather user feedback
- Plan for iterative improvements

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
- SEO impact during transition
- Performance issues with third-party integrations
- User experience disruption
- Checkout flow interruptions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough testing before launch
- Phased rollout approach
- Ability to roll back if necessary
- Dedicated support team during transition

## Training & Documentation

### Internal Training
- Train team members on the new architecture
- Document development and deployment processes

### Maintenance Documentation
- Create documentation for ongoing maintenance
- Document troubleshooting procedures

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Development | 8-10 weeks | Core functionality, Design implementation, API integration |
| Testing | 2-3 weeks | Functional testing, Performance testing, UAT |
| Soft Launch | 2-4 weeks | Subdomain launch, A/B testing, Optimization |
| Full Launch | 1 week | DNS updates, Monitoring, Support |

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: 90+ Lighthouse score, <2s LCP
- **Conversion Rate**: Maintain or improve current conversion rate
- **SEO**: No drop in organic traffic or rankings
- **User Engagement**: Reduced bounce rate, increased time on site

## Conclusion

This migration strategy provides a structured approach to transitioning Beard and Bones from a traditional Shopify theme to a headless architecture. By following this plan, we aim to minimize disruption while maximizing the benefits of the new architecture in terms of performance, flexibility, and user experience.
